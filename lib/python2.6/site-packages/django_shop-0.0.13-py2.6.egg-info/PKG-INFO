        Django-shop
        ===========
        
        This repository hosts the Django-Shop code and documentation.
        
        Django Shop aims to be the easy, fun and fast shop counterpart to django CMS.
        Specifically, we aim at providing a clean, modular and pythonic/djangonic
        implementation of a shop framework,
        that a moderately talented Django programmer should be able to pick up and run
        easily.
        
        The current state is a roughly functional and highly modular system.
        Please refer to docs/plugins.rst to figure out what plugin types are available,
        and what the do
        
        You'll find the detailed doc on
        `RTD <http://readthedocs.org/projects/django-shop/>`_
        
        How to help:
        ============
        
        * Development is done on github - please fork!
        * Most of the discussion around architecture decisions / tools etc... take
        place on IRC (Freenode), on #django-shop
        * Pick a task from the list below :)
        
        Todo:
        =====
        
        * Somebody should kickstart an example shop application using django Shop, to
        use as an example.
        * If you feel like adding templates, please *refrain* from adding fancy styling
        to the core set of templates.
        Styling is awesome, and everybody wants a good looking shop, but it should go
        in example apps, not in core shop :)
        Also, please keep templates to the main templates directory only (so that
        people have a clear view of the templates structure)
        * Writing docs is most welcome :)
        * Refactoring tests to make creating test environments less messy (fixtures?)
        * If you feel like you could solve having multiple currencies in an elegant
        manner, we would really be interested to hear from you
